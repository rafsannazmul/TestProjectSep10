#  Firebase Messaging Project

this project was created for assignment under SSBL | 🆔 Rafsan

ℹ️ This is a very simple chat app made using Firebase Cloud Messaging.

ℹ️ Please refresh the swift package manager caches before building

ℹ️ For development, I have used storyboard, autolayout constraints and Swift as programming language. For adding Firebase in the project I have used Swift Package Manager.

ℹ️ I have integrated FCM but I do no have a paid developer account. So cound not add "Push Notification" capabilities in the project. To test that needs to be implemented. However I have added a notification.apns file that can be dragged in the simulator the check whether push notification is working or not.
